[x] BUG confirmed not set during first sync? new requests dont get k:init at all
  - change how init send works completely to support ?limit and be more robust
[v] _add from loadCache should not query orphan state again
  - it was a different issue, but ok

[v] debug dupe orphan
[x] figure out 10K events limit issue - ignore, will only serve the lastest N events and it will be less than that
[v] change syncEvents method to provide results with callback as they happen. promise only for flow control, i.e. finished
[v] LOGGER
[v] classify events
[v] SSE support more filters, manage single Cut w/ multiple Event services
  - when we have many filters we may need to throttle/schedule cw-data api calls globally
[v] [ENIS] cw-data needs an index on modulename, too slow w/ prod cw-data

[v] CHECK sse updating init data proparly?
[v] refactor state our of ChainwebEventsService into its own class

-- Next

[ ] add /accounts/ endpoint for specific account tracking
[ ] BUG new connection sends initial events to previous connections
  - this is known + intentional: https://github.com/dpskvn/express-sse/issues/21
  [ ] fork express-sse
    - there are good PRs stale for 2 years+
[ ] add permanence category ? lostEvents -> orphaned + not included in canonical chain
[ ] tests
[ ] typescript
[ ] EventService .lastHeight race condition/optimization - or just use .lastHeight - (maxHeightSeen - 2) every time

[ ] meta events/data:
  event:status data:{"event":"open"} 
  - useful to signal connection opened and waiting for data (e.g. accounts)? or is EventSource.open enough? 
  event:status data:{"event":"error","message":"..."}
  event:status data:{"event":"warning","message":"..."}
  event:status data:{"event":"debug","message":"..."}

[ ] generic errors as json

[v] dedupe bug in event state
[v] accounts chainid vs chain
[v] close temporary listeners
[v] accounts minheight not preserved
[v] implement minheight in outer rest queries
[ ] another express-sse bug: not sending [] as first event

[ ] not sending [] when there aren't events to be found

[ ] unregistering event not found (?)

[] enforce allow-Origin, add to config
