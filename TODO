[ ] BUG new connection sends initial events to previous connections
[x] BUG confirmed not set during first sync? new requests dont get k:init at all
  - change how init send works completely to support ?limit and be more robust
[v] _add from loadCache should not query orphan state again
  - it was a different issue, but ok

[ ] debug dupe orphan
[ ] figure out 1M events limit issue
[ ] add /accounts/ endpoint for specific account tracking
[ ] change syncEvents method to provide results with callback as they happen. promise only for flow control, i.e. finished
[ ] add permanence category ? lostEvents -> orphaned + not included in canonical chain
[v] LOGGER
[v] classify events
[v] SSE support more filters, manage single Cut w/ multiple Event services
  - when we have many filters we may need to throttle/schedule cw-data api calls globally
[ ] [ENIS] cw-data needs an index on modulename, too slow w/ prod cw-data

[ ] CHECK sse updating init data proparly?

-- Next

[ ] refactor state our of ChainwebEventsService into its own class
[ ] consider making an account updater, should work well with the account tracker
[ ] tests
[ ] typescript
[ ] EventService .lastHeight race condition/optimization - or just use .lastHeight - (maxHeightSeen - 2) every time

[ ] generic errors as json
